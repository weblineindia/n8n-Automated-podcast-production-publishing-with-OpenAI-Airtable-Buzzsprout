# **Automated Podcast Generation with n8n, OpenAI & Buzzsprout**

## **1.2 Summary (TL;DR)**

This workflow automatically turns any audio file uploaded to Google Drive into a complete podcast episode. It handles transcription, content generation, blog drafting, social copy creation, thumbnail generation, Airtable record updates, Buzzsprout publishing, and finally notifies your team via Slack.
It is a full “audio-to-published-podcast” automation that requires no manual editing.

### **⚡ Quick Start: 10-Step Fast Implementation**

1. Connect Google Drive, OpenAI, Airtable, Slack & Buzzsprout credentials.
2. Upload an audio file to the Drive folder.
3. Workflow triggers automatically.
4. Audio → Text transcription via OpenAI Whisper.
5. AI converts transcript into title, show notes, tags, publish date, etc.
6. AI generates social content & blog article.
7. AI generates YouTube thumbnail (URL saved).
8. Data saved to Airtable.
9. Episode uploaded to Buzzsprout.
10. Slack receives final “Episode Published” notification.

## **1.3 What It Does**

This workflow automates the complete lifecycle of podcast publishing. Once an audio file is placed inside a Google Drive folder, the system takes over: it transcribes the audio, generates structured metadata, creates rich content including a blog post and multiple social media captions, and produces a YouTube-ready thumbnail.

Generated content is saved into Airtable, ensuring you always have a centralized database of episode metadata. The workflow then uploads the processed audio file to Buzzsprout, creating a ready-to-publish podcast entry. Finally, it sends a Slack notification summarizing the episode details.

This workflow eliminates hours of manual podcast editing, writing, and uploading — providing a fast, reliable, and repeatable content automation pipeline.

* Podcasters who want to automate production and publishing
* Marketing teams managing multiple content channels
* Creators who want to repurpose audio into blogs & social content
* Agencies or studios producing podcasts for clients
* Anyone wanting a hands-free “record → upload → publish” podcast system

## **1.5.1 Airtable Table Structure (Required Fields)**

Below is the **exact list of fields** (with correct Airtable field types) that the workflow expects.

| Field Name                 | Airtable Field Type | Purpose                                                   |

| **tiktok_script**          | Long text           | Short TikTok/Shorts script                                |
| **youtube_thumbnail_url**  | URL                 | Thumbnail image URL generated by OpenAI                   |
| **buzzsprout_episode_id**  | Number              | Episode ID returned from Buzzsprout                       |
| **audio_url**              | Single line text    | Buzzsprout final audio file URL                           |
| **published_at**           | Single line text    | Actual published datetime returned by Buzzsprout          |
